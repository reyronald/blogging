## Introduction

When working with databases, managing transactions is crucial to ensure data integrity and consistency. In this post, we'll explore how to handle open database transactions using Prisma, a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript.

## What is a Database Transaction?

A database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. These operations must either all succeed or all fail, ensuring the database remains in a consistent state.

## Why Transactions Matter

Transactions are essential for maintaining data integrity, especially in scenarios involving multiple related operations. Without proper transaction management, you risk leaving your database in an inconsistent state.

## Handling Transactions in Prisma

Prisma provides a straightforward API for managing transactions. You can use the `prisma.$transaction` method to execute multiple operations within a single transaction. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (prisma) => {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: { name: "Alice" },
  });

  const post = await prisma.post.create({
    data: { title: "Hello World", authorId: user.id },
  });

  return { user, post };
});
```

## Common Pitfalls

When dealing with transactions, it's important to be aware of common pitfalls such as deadlocks and long-running transactions. These can lead to performance issues and data inconsistencies.

## Conclusion

Properly managing database transactions is key to ensuring data integrity and consistency. Prisma's transaction API makes it easy to handle transactions in your Node.js and TypeScript applications. Stay tuned for more detailed examples and best practices in future posts.
